# Notifications

Platform.sh can notify you when various events happen on your project, in any environment.  At this time the only notification provided is low disk space available but others may be added in the future.

## Available notifications

### Low-disk warning

If any notifications are configured, Platform.sh will monitor disk space usage on all applications and services in your cluster.  

* If and when available disk space drops below 20%, a warning notification is generated.
* If and when available disk space drops below 10%, a critical notification is generated.
* If and when available disk space goes back above 20% after previously having been lower, an all-clear notification is generated.

Notifications are generated every 5 minutes, so there may be a brief delay between when the threshold is crossed and when the notification is triggered.

## Configuring notifications

Health notifications can be setup via the [Platform CLI](/overview/cli.md), through a number of different channels.

### Email notifications

A notification can trigger an email to be sent, from an address of your choosing to one or more addresses of your choosing.

To do so, register a `health.email` integration as follows:

```bash
platform integration:add --type=health.email --from-address=you@example.com --recipients=them@example.com --recipients=others@example.com
```

The `from-address` is whatever address you want the email to appear to be from.  You must specify one or more `recipients`, each as its own switch.  It is completely fine to use the same address for both `from-address` and `recipients`.

### Slack notifications

A notification can trigger a message to be sent to a Slack bot.  First, create a new custom "[bot user](https://api.slack.com/bot-users)" for your Slack group and configure the channels you wish it to live in.  Note the API Token provided by Slack.

Then register that Slack bot with Platform.sh using a `health.slack` integration:

```bash
platform integration:add --type=health.slack --token=YOUR_API_TOKEN --channel=#channelname
```

That will trigger the corresponding bot to post a notification to the `#channelname` channel in your Slack group.

### Pager Duty notifications

A notification can trigger a message to be sent via Pager Duty, if you are using that service.  First, create a new "[integration](https://www.pagerduty.com/integrations/)" using the v2 API.  Copy the routing key it provides.

Now register a `health.pagerduty` integration as follows:


```bash
platform integration:add --type=health.pagerduty --routing_key=YOUR_ROUTING_KEY
```

Any notification will now trigger an alert in Pager Duty.
